# About

On March 13, 2020, the City declared a local emergency in response to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Several actions were taken by the City to provide immediate economic relief to city businesses and residents, including the funding of small business loans of $1.1 million to City businesses, procurement of emergency supplies for the homeless (estimated at $250,000), emergency meal programs, and lodging for essential City staff.

Given the significant needs and quick response necessary during an emergency, the annual budget resolution provides authority to the City Manager to accept and spend grant funding in advance of Council authority (Resolution 2019-0248, Section 11.1(2); Resolution 2020-0123, Section 11.1(B)). This authority requires the City Manager to report back to Council within 60 days of receiving formal program documents or funding. The following summarizes the awards and funding received to date to assist with our response to the pandemic.

- On April 21, 2020, the City received $89.6 million in Coronavirus Relief Funds (CRF) from passage of the federal government’s CARES Act.
- On April 17, 2020, the City received $0.3 million from the federal government’s CARES Act fund specific to the Fire Department’s delivery of emergency medical services (EMS), including labor associated with Mobile Integrated Health and the COVID Task Force.
- The Police Department received notification of the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Justice Programs Bureau of Justice Assistance Coronavirus Emergency Supplemental Funding Program Solicitation and will be applying for $795,286 by May 29, 2020.

## Framework and Funding Priorities:

On May 12, 2020, Council participated in a workshop to discuss a CRF framework and funding priorities. During the workshop, Council expressed overall interest in funding programs and projects that provide small business assistance, get people back to work, offer opportunities for youth enrichment, address homelessness and housing issues, and support families impacted by this pandemic. The deadline for expending CRF funds is December 30, 2020. Given this short time frame, Council requested staff identify projects and programs for immediate CRF funding and implementation.

On May 26, 2020 Council committed $28 million in CRF to support immediate local economic relief services and programs for residents and businesses. As we continue to prepare CARES Act funding recommendations, staff will review funding suggestions for eligibility and alignment with identified Council priority areas:

- **Small Business Assistance:** Financial, technical, and entrepreneurship assistance to small businesses, non-profits, and community-based organizations (CBOs).
- **Workforce Training:** Fund programs and partner with workforce development providers, CBOs, and educational partners at all levels to retrain and uptrain workers dislocated due to the pandemic. 
- **Youth Enrichment:** Implement robust programs, curriculum, and service for youth, including providing the necessary transportation and technology to support these programs.
- **Family Services:** Funding to support additional services for Sacramento families, including the expansion and availability of childcare services, food access, and programs that address domestic violence exacerbated by the stay-at-home orders.
- **Homeless Services & Rapid Re-Housing:** Services to place unhoused individuals into permanent housing and implement homeless aversion programs.
- **Arts, The Creative Economy & Tourism:** Financial and technical assistance directly to support the arts, tourism, and creative economy that have been devastated by the current pandemic.

To ensure the entire community has an opportunity to weigh in, the City Auditor is conducting community surveys for both residents and businesses to provide insight and suggestions for CRF spending. Additionally, Council expressed a commitment to equity and inclusion. Each program and project will be screened through an equity lens to ensure CARES spending benefits our entire community, particularly those communities most impacted.
